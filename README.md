# Card Generator

A simple WPF application for creating cards for custom card games, which allows you to add your own picture and flavour text to cards in decks, and then export them to PDF for printing.

## TODO
- code cleanup
- UI cleanup
- persist the local state

## Future goals
- add AI generation for pictures and text based on prompts
- allow other file types (maybe custom one as well)
- create website UI and turn into functional game (ala Jackbox)
